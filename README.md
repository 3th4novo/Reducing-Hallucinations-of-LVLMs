# Reducing Hallucinations of LVLMs: Improving VCD with Cosine-Beta Noise Scheduling

This is the official github repository of Reducing Hallucinations of LVLMs: a UCLA COM SCI 263 course project. In this project, we employed a different diffusion noise scheduler that can furtherly improve the the performance of the state-of-the-art train-free method VCD in the task of reducing hallucinations of LVLMs.

##  Usage
### Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -yn Reducing-Hallucinations-of-LVLMs python=3.11
conda activate Reducing-Hallucinations-of-LVLMs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
